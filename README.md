# Max Temperature Choropleth Map of Indian States

This project showcases the maximum temperatures of various Indian states during the month of May using a choropleth map created with Python.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to visualize the maximum temperatures across Indian states in May using a choropleth map. This map provides a clear and intuitive way to understand the temperature variations across the country.

## Data

The data for maximum temperatures have been sourced from various websites on the internet and ChatGPT. Please note that the data might not be 100% accurate.

## temp.csv
This file contains the maximum temperature data for various states in India.

## GeoJSON
GeoJSON is an open standard format designed for representing simple geographical features, along with their non-spatial attributes.

## Creation of Choropleth Map

The choropleth map of India was created using Python. I referred to the following GitHub repository for guidance: __abhiwebdev202/choropleth-python-tutorial-India-map.__

## Visualization

The map uses a color scale to represent the maximum temperatures, with colors ranging from blue (cooler temperatures) to red (hotter temperatures).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need:

Python 3.x
Plotly
Pandas
